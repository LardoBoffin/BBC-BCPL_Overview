# BBC Micro BCPL Overview

This repository consists of Master Discs and Documents for Acornsoft's BCPL and is very much a work in progress!

Please see https://stardot.org.uk/forums/viewtopic.php?f=42&t=21166 for scanned documents.

The Standalone Generator scanned document can be found in Documents, along with a scanned keystrip for ED. There are three versions of the keystrip - the original scan, a Word doc with it embedded and more or less correctly sized to be printed out in A4 and a PDF of the Word doc. The scan needs a bit of tidying up when I get chance but it perfectly usable.

The document BCPL Overview gives an introduction to using BCPL on the Beeb. It will be updated and new sections added.
