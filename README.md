# BBC Micro BCPL Overview

This repository consists of Master Discs and Documents for Acornsoft's BCPL and is very much a work in progress!

Currently the only scanned copy of the full User Guide can be found here: http://www.8bs.com/othrdnld/manuals/applications.shtml. It is around 268MB in size and is in desperate need of being OCR'd or similar.

The Standalone Generator scanned document can be found in Documents, along with a scanned keystrip for ED. There are three versions of the keystrinp - the original scan, a Word doc with it embedded and more or less correctly sized to be printed out in A4 and a PDF of the Word doc. The scan needs a bit of tidying up when I get chance but it perfectly usable.

I have yet to get hold of a scanned copy of the Calculations Package manual.
